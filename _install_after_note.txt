Hey, thanks for installing the NullosAdmin module.

However, you need to do a few more steps to make sure everything is ok:

open the configuration file for the module Core (config/modules/Core.conf.php),
and ensure the following variables are set:


- dualSite: true
- themeBack: nullosAdmin
- themeFront: ApplicationParameters::get("theme")
- defaultProtocol: https                    // or put http here if you prefer (but it's not recommended)
- uriPrefixBackoffice: /admin               // choose your admin namespace url here...


Enjoy :)
